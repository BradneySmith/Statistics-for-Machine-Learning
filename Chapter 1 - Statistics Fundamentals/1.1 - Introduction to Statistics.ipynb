    "### 1.1 - Definition of Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In science we often conduct **experiments** to learn more about the world and our place within it. Experiments are tests that allow us to make new discoveries or test theories we may have. These often generate a large amount of data, and so we need a systematic way to extract meaning from the results. This is achieved using **statistics**. Statistics is defined by Joseph Watkins in *An Introduction to the Science of Statistics* [1] as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> a mathematical science that is concerned with the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition lists the 4 main stages of the statistical process. Once an experiment has been completed, the results can be gathered (*collection*). Alternatively if experiments have already taken place an **observation** can be made, which is the process as collating existing results from one of more experiments. These results can then be broken down using statistical tests (*analysis*), which gives a way to understand what the data means (*interpretation*) and why these results were found (*explanation*). Finally, the results can be summarised numerically using measures of center and spread for example, or visually using plots and chats. Performing these 4 fundamental steps allows us to better understand the results of an experiment, and gain insight into the area we are studying.\n",

    "### 1.2 - Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Since statistics works with data, it is important to discuss the different forms that data may come in. Data is collected for each **individual** in a group, called a **population**. Each individual can have many characteristics that are of interest, for a example a person could be measured for their height, shoe size, and hair colour. The characteristics of interest are called **variables**, since their values may vary from individual to individual. A **dataset** is the total collection of data measured for each individual. If only one variable is measured for each individual, the dataset is said to be **univariate** (meaning *one variable*). If multiple variables are measured for each individual, the dataset is said to be **multivariate** (meaning *multiple variables*). A common type of multivariate data is **bivariate** data, which is the case when exactly two variables are measured for each individual. For example, only measuring the height and weight for individuals in a population will generate bivariate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can come in 2 distinct types [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categoric Variables\n",
    "* Quantitative Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categoric Variables** are characteristics which cannot be described using numbers, for example: hair colour or sex. For this reason they are also called Qualitative Variables. Categoric variables can be broken down further into 3 sub-types: ordinal, nominal and dichotomous. **Ordinal** variables imply a form of ranking: for example: small, medium and large. **Nominal** variables do not imply a form a ranking, for example: red, blue, green. **Dichotomous** variables are nominal variables since they do not imply ranking, but are restricted to only taking one of two values, for example: yes or no, male or female, true or false etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Variables** are characteristics which can be described using numbers, for example: height and shoe size. This can be broken down further into **discrete variables** and **continuous variables**. Discrete variables are quantitative variables that can only take certain numeric values, for example: the numbers on a di or shoe size. Continuous variables are quantitative variables that can take any numeric value (including any decimal value), for example: height, weight, distance, speed etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of variable you are working with can influence the methods used for each step of the statistical process, and so it is important to take note of the data types being used. This includes how the data is collected, analysed, interpreted and presented.\n",

    "* Descriptive Statistics\n",

    "\n",
    "**Descriptive Statistics** is the branch of statistics concerned with organising and summarising data using tables, graphs and numerical values. This provides a description of the data, hence the name *descriptive* statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inerfential Statistics** is the branch of statistics concerned with using a sample from a population to make generalisations (usually to make predictions), and then assess the reliability of those generalisations. This includes techniques such as Hypothesis Testing and Regression which are covered in later notebooks.\n",

    "### 1.4 - Populations vs Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, the total collection of individuals that can be measured for an experiment is called a population. In an ideal experiment it would be preferable to take measurements for every individual in a population. This would ensure that any statistical test performed would be representative of the entire population. However, it is often the case that experiment populations are very large, and it is not feasible to spend the resources (time and money) gathering that amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, **samples** are often taken. A sample should be a collection of measurements from a random subset of a population. The subset should be random to ensure that no bias is introduced when selecting individuals, so that sample set is representative of the population. The larger the sample size (the more individuals selected), the more accurately the sample statistics can be expected to reflect the population statistics.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 1)** Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in any experiment/observation should be to define the problem clearly. This will determine the variable types that will be collected (e.g. categoric, quantitative etc), and how the collection process will take place.\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2)** Collection\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3)** Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset [4]. This is particularly important when combining multiple existing datasets since there may be opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4)** Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis stage is where statistical techniques can start to be applied to the data. Recall that the techniques that are applied are dependent on the type of the data, so this will influence the types of studies that can be conducted. For example, it might not make sense to calculate the *mean* hair colour, but maybe the *modal* value would be a good measure of center. The analysis stage can be broken into two parts: **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) and formal analysis. EDA is a vital preliminary step to explore the data and determine which formal analysis methods may be most appropriate to apply. After this, the formal analysis can take place.\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5)** Interpretation and Explanation\n",

    "The results of the statistical tests in the previous stage can then be applied in the context of the experiment. This is a crucial part of the statistical process, and without this step the results of the test are meaningless. From here meaning can be extracted, and understanding about the experiment can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6)** Presentation and Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results can be presented in a numerical or graphical summary. This output can then be used to make predictions and apply the results to answer future questions (without having to conduct an experiment to determine the answer).\n",

Graphical representations of data are very useful for gaining intuition about how data is spread and what relationships/trends exist etc. However, it is also important to define some numerical quantities that can be used to describe data. These are a way to summarise entire datasets with a single value, and are fundamental in developing more complex statistical techniques. In many ways these quantities are much more powerful than graphical representations, and so are covered first in this series of notebooks. These values are calculated based on numerical data, and so this notebook will mostly concern quantitative datasets. Some of the numerical values presented here are affected significantly by outliers, which are extreme values that are much smaller or much greater than the other values in a dataset. This issue is discussed in greater depth at the end of this section.\n",

For example, if a couple are looking to buy a house in an area, they may look for the price of a typical house in that neighbourhood. This is an example of a measure of center. Another example may be finding the typical height of people in a population. Of course the population will show a lot of variability, but by knowing the typical height of a person, a company can design products to suit more people's needs. These are just a couple of examples where a summary of a dataset would be useful, but hopefully the motivation for measures of center is clear.

    "In mathematics, **average** is a generic term that is used to describe the central value in a dataset. This idea is often used to summarise data using a single number, which in statistics is called a measure of center. In everyday conversation, the terms *average* and *mean* are used interchangably, but there is a distinct difference between them. Whereas *average* is a generic term for any central value, **mean** refers to a specific set of quantities that describe a central value. That is to say, every mean is an average, but not every average is a mean. Some examples of non-mean averages include the median and mode, which are discussed later in this section. \n",

Other types of mean exist too, including the: geometric mean, harmonic mean, truncated mean, weighted mean, quadratic mean, and more. Collectively, the three classical means: the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean, are known as the Pythagorean means. These were studied extensively in ancient Greece due to their importance in geometry and music.

The mean uses every data point to calculate a central value (unlike the midrange) and so can be considered a *true* summary of the dataset. The mean is also the value which minimises the difference between itself and every data point. However, the mean can be affected by outliers, which if significant enough can dramatically change the central value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For datasets with significant outliers the median may be a more appropriate choice. Consider a study into the wealth distribution of people in the United States. A very small number of billionaires will dramatically increase the mean value for yearly income, and so this central value will not be representative of the population. Instead the median could be used, which is not affected by outliers. This would give a more accurate summary of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is less commonly used as a measure of center, but that is not to say it is not useful. The mode is often used for qualitative data, where numerical quantities such as the median and mean do not make sense. The mode can also be used to describe data that is multimodal (data with multiple modal values), which is a property not captured by any other measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the midrange is potentially the least common of the 4 measures of center presented here. The midrange is a useful measure to show the center of the measurements that were made, but is highly sensitive to extreme values (since it is only calculated using 2 values out of the entire dataset). The midrange may be a good choice for well-behaved data with no extreme values.\n",

    "### 3.1 - What are Measures of Spread?\n",
    "\n",
    "The spread (also called variability and dispersion) of data is how the measurements are distributed across the set of possible values. For example if a di is rolled 100 times, did every number appear roughly the same amount of times (uniformally distributed)? Did one number appear much more often than the other numbers (non-uniformally distributed)? There are many different ways that data can be spread, that is to say there are many **distributions**. The are two categories are measures we can use to describe spread: median-based measures and mean-based measures. Examples of each are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Median-Based Measures:\n",
    "* Lower Quartile\n",
    "* Upper Quartile\n",
    "* Interquartile Range\n",

    "Median-based measures include quartiles and percentiles, and are found in a similar way to the median. These quantities rely on first sorting a dataset in ascending order, then selecting a value to represent the spread using some criteria.

    "A measure of center alone is not enough to describe the distribution of data in a dataset. To illustrate this 3 plots have been drawn below. These all feature 11 points, and have identical mean, median, mode and midrange values - however the data look very different. This highlights the importance of a measure of spread, characterising how far the points are spread apart.\n",

    "\n",
    "Quartiles extend the idea of the median, which is the middle of ordered data, to describe the first and final quarter of the data. The **lower quartile** is the value of the data located at the 25% point of the ordered data, and the **upper quartile** is the value of the data located at the 75% point. The 50% point is the median, and so can be thought of as the *middle quartile*. This measure splits the data into quarters, hence the collective name *quartiles*. The **interquartile range** is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. Below are two examples for determining the lower and upper quartiles of some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the number of data points is a multiple of 4 plus 3, which means the data can be split into four equal parts separated by a lower quartile, median and upper quartile. In cases like this, the lower and upper quartiles can be simply read from the ordered data at positions $\\frac{n+1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3(n+1)}{4}$ respectively. In this example there are 11 data points, and so the lower and upper quartiles are located at positions 3 and 9:\n",

In cases like this the quartiles lie between two values. This is dealt with in the same way as finding the median for an even number of measurements: take the arithmetic of the values surrounding the quartile position. Mathematically this is achieved by summing the values at positions $\\frac{(n+1)}{4}$ and $\\frac{n+1}{4} + 1$ for the lower quartile, or $\\frac{3(n+1)}{4}$ and $\\frac{3(n+1)}{4} + 1$ for the upper quartile, and dividing the result by 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Percentiles** are extend the idea of quartiles further, so that the dataset is divided into 100 parts rather than 4. More formally, this can be defined as [5]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> a measure indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of percentiles, the lower quartile, median and upper quartile represent the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles respectively. In a similar way to the interquartile range, the **interpercentile range** is the difference between two percentil values. For example, the interpercentile range between the 100th and 80th percentiles could be used to study the top 20% of applicants at a university. The general name for divisions of a dataset is **quantiles**. Percentiles are quantiles with 100 divisions, and quartiles are quantiles with 4 divisions. In practice, any number of divisions can be used, but the ones shown here are the most common.\n",

    "### 3.7 - Summarising Quartiles and Medians with Box Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The *five number summary* is a way to summarise median-based measures of spread for a dataset using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **minimum** - 0th quartile, 0th percentile\n",
    "* **lower quartile** - 1st quartile, 25th percentile\n",
    "* **median** - 2nd quartile, 50th percentile\n",
    "* **upper quartile** - 3rd quartile, 75th percentile\n",
    "* **maximum** - 4th quartile, 100th percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "These five values can be shown graphically using a **boxplot** (or *box and whisker diagram*). A boxplot draws a vertical rectangle with the lower side defined by the lower quartile, the upper side defined by the upper quartile, and the median line drawn horizontally across the middle. The minimum and maximum values are connected to the box by thin lines called *whiskers*. These plots show the spread of data at the 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% marks, and visualise the distribution throughout the dataset. Below are a set of boxplots for each of the datasets given at the beginning of this section. The median values are identical, but the difference in spread is very clearly shown by the size of the box for each plot."

    "### 3.9 - Mean Absolute Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **deviation** is the difference between a single point and the mean of a dataset. For example, an individual with a height of 70 inches in a population with mean height 68 inches has a deviation of 2 inches from the mean. An individual with a height of 66 inches in the same population will have a height of -2 inches from the mean. An absolute deviation is a deviation without consideration for if the measurement is above or below the mean. In this example, the absolute deviations of both individuals will be 2, since only the magnitude of the deviation is important and not the sign. The deviation between every point and the mean can be summed and divided by the number of points to give the average deviation. This is used as a measure of the spread in the dataset, and is called the **Mean Absolute Deviation** (MAD). Consider the data from Data 1 earlier in the notebook. The MAD can be found as follows:\n",

This is clearly a poor measurement for variability, and hence highlights the need for absolute values. The MAD can take any non-negative value, and a value of 0 indicates a dataset of identical measurements. The greater the MAD value, the greater the spread in the data.\n",

    "### 3.10 - Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean absolute deviation is one method to quantify spread using deviations, however it is not the most commonly used measure. More often the **Standard Deviation** is used, which historically was called the *error of mean square* or *mean error*. The term we use today was coined by Karl Pearson in his 1893 paper *Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution*, and is believed to reflect his recommendation for its widespread usage [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation also finds an average deviation from the mean, but instead squares each of the deviation terms rather than taking the absolute value. The result has squared units and so the sum of the square deviations must be square rooted. This process produces two quantities: the variance (average squared deviation) and the standard deviation (average deviation). The population variance and standard deviation are denoted by the Greek symbols $\\sigma^2$ and $\\sigma$ respectively, and have the following formulae:\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance and standard deviation have a distinct advantage over the mean absolute deviation: the variance is continuously differentiable. The variance does not take absolute values, but instead squares the deviations and so gives a linear function. The mean absolute difference uses a piece-wise function and so is non-linear. This becomes an important distinction when applying calculus to these measures, as is shown in *Sampling a Distribution and Bessel's Correction*. For interest some mathematicians, such as Stephen Gorard, still advocate for the use of MAD over variance and standard deviation though this is not a mainstream opinion [6].\n",

    "### 3.11 - Alternative Form for the Variance Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for variance has a summation of two terms: an $x_i$ term and a $\\mu$ term. One of the properties of the summation operator is that the summation of terms together is equal to the summation of each term individually. This property is called **linearity** [7], and means the terms can be separated out into two summations as shown below. Also note that variance can be written as $Var(x)$ as well as $\\sigma^2$ - this is helpful when working with multiple variables. Combining these facts gives:\n",

    "\n",

    "Statistics is an essential skill for understanding data. A solid foundation is necessary across a vast array of technical areas, spanning science, technology, engineering and beyond. The notebooks in this repository give an overview of some of the core concepts in descriptive and inferrential statistics, and relate them back to the field of machine learning. With a strong statistics background, the concepts used to developed artificial intelligence become much more approachable. The goal is that these notebooks give a starting point to develop a deeper understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning, with an appreciation for the statistical techniques that drive these fields."
