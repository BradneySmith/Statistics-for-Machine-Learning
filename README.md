# Statistics for Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository serves as a log for my personal study of statistics in machine learning methods. The content is divided into sections, each containing Jupyter Notebooks to support an overarching theme. For example, *Chapter 2 - Regression* covers a number of topics that are useful in building different regression models, then covers implementing these models using pure Python functions/classes (written by myself), followed by standard implementations from data science libraries such as Sci-Kit Learn and Statmodels. The goal of this project is to improve my understanding of current machine learning methods, by building a solid knowledge from first principles up to the latest technology.

## Highlights

This project makes use of geometric interpretations to enhance the written explanations, and as such is an excellent opportunity to continuously improve my data visualisation skills. Some highlights from this project are shown below, many of which are plots and graphics which best showcase some of the concepts covered.
